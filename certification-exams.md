# Exam Prep for Certification type exams
These are what I've found works best for me when going to certification type exams.

## Location
My preference is to take the exam at a local testing centre. Whilst this does involve about an hour of travel in each direction, it leaves me completely free from distractions which may happen at home such as delivery drivers knocking at the door with parcels, dealing with venomous insects/reptiles, giving attention to children/family and smelly dogs that have learned to show off during zoom calls by barking being unruly and generally misbehaving.

## Timing
I feel like I'm a "morning person" so I book my exam for the morning session when my concentration is at it's very best.

## Clothing
Wear a t-shirt or pullover not a shirt with rolled up sleeves. The invigilators have asked me to roll down my sleeves. If you wear a shirt, don't roll up the sleeves. Apparently people like to cheat.

## Food
Eat a nutritious slack before my exam. I like to have a tuna sandwich and a banana about 30 minutes prior to the start of the exam.

Bananas and tuna are supposed to be good "brain foods". As a [bear of little brain](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/142015-when-you-are-a-bear-of-very-little-brain-and) I like to imagine that eating this gives me maximum advantage.

## Exam Strategy
Race through and answer everything I know that I know the answer to as fast as I can, leaving blank the ones I don't know. As I see it this has the following advantages;

- See every question. Sometimes a later question will help you to work out the answer to an earlier question.
- Builds confidence.
- Leaves more time for the more difficult questions.

Dealing with questions where I've no clue is harder. I try to eliminate the impossible so if the question is:

Which animal has 4 legs and barks:

A. Cow
B. Duck
C. Dog
D. Wolf

Then I know I can get rid of both cow and duck. If I still don't know the answer then it's a 50 percent chance in the guess not a 25 percent chance.
